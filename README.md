# Stress Detection from Social Media Articles: New Dataset Benchmark and Analytical Study
This repository contains the datasets for **classification of stress** from text-based social media articles from Reddit and Twitter, which were created within the paper titled "Stress Detection from Social Media Articles: New Dataset Benchmark and Analytical Study". 

***Status - Accepted for Oral Presentation at IEEE WCCI 2022, IJCNN track.***

## Overview of the datasets
We construct four high quality datasets using the text articles from Reddit and Twitter. Against each of the articles is a class label with a value of '0' or '1', where '0' specifies a *Stress Negative* article and '1' specifies a *Stress Positive* article. Annotation was done using an automated DNN-based strategy highlighted in the aforementioned study.

The description about each of the datasets is given as under:

- **Reddit Title**: Consists of titles from the articles collected from both stress and non-stress related subreddits from Reddit.  
- **Reddit Combi**: Consists of title and body text combined together to form a single text sequence, collected from both stress and non-stress related subreddits from Reddit.  
- **Twitter Full**: Consists of stress and non-stress related tweets, collected from Twitter.  
- **Twitter Non-Advert**: Consists of the denoised version of the **Twitter Full** dataset.  

The details about the dataset may be directly referred to from the study.
